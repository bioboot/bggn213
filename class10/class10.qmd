# What is in the PDB?

Downloaded a CSV file with current composition data from: https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv", row.names = 1)
head(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

```{r}
x <- "2,222"
as.numeric(x)
```

```{r}
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
x <- "2,222"

as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```


```{r}

commasum <- function(x) {
  # Remove comma, convert to numeric and sum
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}
```

```{r}
commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```
I can now `apply()` this function to my wee table to get all the numbers I need.

```{r}
round(apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum) / 
        commasum(pdbstats$Total) * 100, 2)
```





> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

X.ray: 84.54%. 
EM: 8.72%. 

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?


> Q3. How does the total number of protein structures in the PDB relate to the total number of protein sequences in UniProt?

```{r}
186898/250322721 * 100

```

# Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

We will use the Mol* (mol-star) viewer at : https://molstar.org/viewer/.

## Working with structures in R

We will use the bio3d package for structural bioinformatics.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```


```{r}
aa123(pdbseq(hiv)[25])
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Normal mode analysis (NMA) a bioinformatics method to predict functional motions and large-scale structure changes.


```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Make a wee movie (a.k.a "trajectory") of these predicted motions
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_movie.pdb")
```


# Quick comparative analysis of structures

Extract sequence and run a BLAST search
```{r}
s <- pdbseq(adk)
blast <- blast.pdb(s)
plot(blast)
```

Get the results from BLAST and download all the top hits.

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```


# PCA of all these ADK structures

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```


```{r}
mktrj(pc.xray, file="pca_movie.pdb")
```
